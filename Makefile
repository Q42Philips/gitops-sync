# The help will print out all targets with their descriptions organized bellow their categories. The categories are represented by `##@` and the target descriptions by `##`.
# The awk commands is responsable to read the entire set of makefiles included in this invocation, looking for lines of the file as xyz: ## something, and then pretty-format the target and help. Then, if there's a line with ##@ something, that gets pretty-printed as a category.
